NAME::
feof - Check if End Of File has been reached.


SYNOPSIS::

[source,c]
---------------------
#include <stdio.h>

int feof(FILE *stream);
---------------------

DESCRIPTION::

Tests if the position indicator of a given stream has
reached the End of File.

Once End Of File has been reached, further reading operations on
the same stream return +EOF+ until +rewind()+ or +fseek()+ are called
changing the position indicator to a valid position. Because the
+EOF+ value returned by many input functions may indicate either the
End-Of-File or an error, this function should be called to ensure
the End Of File has been reached.


RETURN VALUE::

A non-zero value is returned in the case that the
position indicator reached the End Of File in the last input
operation with the specified stream, otherwise +0+ is returned.


SEE ALSO::
