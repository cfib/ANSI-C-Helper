NAME::
getc - Get the next character.

SYNOPSIS::

[source,c]
---------------------
#include <stdio.h>

int getc(FILE *stream); 
---------------------

DESCRIPTION::

Returns the next character of the stream and increases
the file pointer to point to the next character. This routine is
normally implemented as a macro with the same result as
+fgetc()+.

PARAMETERS::

* stream - Pointer to an open file.

RETURN VALUE::

The character read is returned as an +int+ value. If the
End Of File has been reached or there has been an error reading,
the function returns EOF. You can use +ferror()+ or +feof()+ to
determine whether an error happened or the End-Of-File was
reached.

SEE ALSO::

+fputc+, +fread+, +fwrite+
