NAME::
memcmp - Compare two buffers.

SYNOPSIS::

[source,c]
---------------------
#include <string.h>

int memcmp ( const void * buffer1, const void * buffer2, size_t num ); 
---------------------

DESCRIPTION::
Compares the fisrt num bytes of two memory blocks pointed by buffer1 and buffer2.

PARAMETERS::

* buffer1 - Pointer to buffer.
* buffer2 - Pointer to buffer.
* num - Number of bytes to compare.

RETURN VALUE::

Returns a value indicating the relationship between the buffers:


[options="header",frame="all",colspecs="cl",cols="^2,10",caption_voffset="0mm"]
|=================================================
| return value   | description
| < 0            | buffer1 is less than buffer2
| 0              | buffer1 is the same as buffer2
| > 0            | buffer1 is greater than buffer2
|=================================================


For comparative purposes, each byte is considered as +unsigned char+.
