NAME::
mktime - Convert tm structure to time_t value.

SYNOPSIS::

[source,c]
---------------------
#include <time.h>

time_t mktime ( struct tm * ptm ); 
---------------------

DESCRIPTION::
Checks the members of the +tm+ structure passed as
parameter +ptm+ adjusting the values if the ones provided are not in
the possible range or they are incomplete or mistaken and then
translates that structure to a +time_t+ value (seconds elapsed since
Jan 1, 1970) that is returned. The original values of +tm_wday+ and
+tm_yday+ members of +ptm+ are ignored and filled with the
correspondent ones to the calculated date. The range of +tm_mday+ is
not checked until +tm_mon+ and +tm_year+ are determined.

PARAMETERS::

* ptm - Pointer to a +tm+ structure, that contains data to be computed.


RETURN VALUE::
A +time_t+ value corresponding to the date and time passed in +ptm+ parameter. On error, a -1 value is returned.

SEE ALSO::

+asctime+, +gmtime+, +localtime+, +time+
