setlocale
---------

NAME::
setlocale - set the current locale.

SYNOPSIS::

[source,c]
---------------------
#include <locale.h>

char *setlocale(int category, const char * locale);
---------------------

DESCRIPTION::

The +setlocale()+ function is used to set or query the program's current locale. If locale is "C" or "POSIX", the current locale is set to the portable locale. +
If locale is "", the locale is set to the default locale which is selected from the environment variable LANG. +
On startup of the main program, the portable "C" locale is selected as default. +
The argument category determines which functions are influenced by the new locale:

* LC_ALL - for all of the locale.
* LC_COLLATE - for the functions +strcoll()+ and +strxfrm()+.
* LC_CTYPE - for the character classification and conversion routines.
* LC_MONETARY - for +localeconv()+.
* LC_NUMERIC - for the decimal character.
* LC_TIME - for +strftime()+. 
* NULL if the request cannot not be honored. This string may be allocated in static storage.

A program may be made portable to all locales by calling +setlocale(LC_ALL, "" )+ after program
initialization, by using the values returned from a +localeconv()+ call for locale - dependent information and by using +strcoll()+ or +strxfrm()+ functions to compare strings.

EXAMPLE::

A code snippet similar to the following one can be used to change the locale or a portion thereof for a limited duration:

[source,c]
---------------------
include::src/setlocale.c[]
---------------------
