[[stddef]]
stddef
------

SYNOPSIS::

[source,c]
---------------------
#include <stddef.h>
---------------------

DESCRIPTION::

The +stddef+ header defines several standard definitions. Many of these definitions also appear in other
headers:

* ptrdiff_t - is the result of subtracting two pointers.
* size_t - is the unsigned integer result of the sizeof keyword.
* wchar_t - is an integer type of the size of a wide character constant.
* NULL - is the value of a null pointer constant.
* offsetof(type, member-designator) - This results in a constant integer of type size_t which is the offset in bytes of a structure member from the beginning of the structure. The member is given by member-designator, and the name of the structure is given in type.

EXAMPLE::

[source,c]
---------------------
include::src/stddef.c[]
---------------------

OUTPUT::

.....
$ gcc -Wall stddef.c
$ ./a.out 
level is at 100 byte.
