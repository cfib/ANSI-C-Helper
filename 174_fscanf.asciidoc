fscanf
------

NAME::
fscanf - Read formatted data from a stream.

SYNOPSIS::

[source,c]
---------------------
#include <stdio.h>

int fscanf( FILE *stream , const char *format [ , argument , ...] ); 
---------------------

DESCRIPTION::

Reads data from the current position of stream and
stores it into the locations given by argument(s). Locations
pointed by each argument are filled with their corresponding type
of value requested in the format string. There must be the same
number of type specifiers in format string than arguments
passed.

PARAMETERS::

* stream - Pointer to an open file.
* format - String that can contain one or more of these items:



Whitespace characters::
the function will read and ignore any whitespace characters (this includes blank, newline and tab characters) encountered before the next non-whitespace character. This includes any quantity of whitespace characters (including none).

Non-whitespace characters::
(any character not including blank, newline, tab, or any format specifier beginning with `%` character): this cause that the function read and discard any character that match the given non-whitespace character. If this character is not found the function ends returning error.

Format specifiers::
A sequence of characters begining with `%` indicates that next data has to be read and stored at the
location pointed by its corresponding argument with a given format that is specified following this prototype: `%[*][width][modifiers]type` where:


[frame="all",colspecs="cl",caption_voffset="0mm",cols="^1,9a"]
|====================================================================
| *          |Data is read but ignored. It is not assigned to the corresponding argument.
| width      |Specifies the maximum number of characters to be read.
| modifiers  
|Specifies a different size for the data pointed by argument:

- h: short int
- l: long int (if integer) or double (if floating point).
- L: long double

| type       |Character specifying the type of data that is expected and how it has to be read. See next table.

| c         | Single character: Reads the next character (whitespace characters included). | char *
| d         | Decimal integer: Number optionally prepended with a sign.                    | int *
| e,E,f,g,G | Floating point: Decimal number containing a decimal point, optionally prepended by a sign and optionally followed by the +e+ or +E+ character and a decimal number. Valid entries are -732.103 or 7.12e4 | float *
| o         | Octal integer.                                                               | int *
| s         | String of characters. This will read subsequent characters until a whitespace is found (whitespace characters are blank, newline and tab).                                  | char *(string)
| u         | Unsigned decimal integer.                                                    | unsigned int *
| x         | Hexadecimal integer.                                                         | int *

argument(s) - pointer to objects or structures to be filled with data read as specified by format
string. There must be the same number of these parameters than the number of format tags. NOTE: These arguments must be pointers: if you want to store the result of a +scanf+ operation on a standard variable you should precede it with the reference operator, i.e. an ampersand sign: `&`

RETURN VALUE::

The number of items successfully read. This count doesn't include any ignored fields. If EOF is returned an error has occurred before the first assignation could be done.

SEE ALSO::

+scanf+, +fprintf+, +fopen+, +fclose+

EXAMPLE::

[source,c]
---------------------
include::src/fscanf.c[]
---------------------


This sample code creates a file using the given command-line argument as file name and (1) stores a float number and a string, then, (2) the stream is rewinded and both values are read with +fscanf+. Finally (3) the program prints respective information to stdout.

OUTPUT::

.....
$ gcc -Wall -lm fscanf.c
$ ./a.out test.txt
I have read: 3.141593 and PI 
$ cat test.txt
3.141593 PI
