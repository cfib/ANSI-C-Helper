freopen
-------

NAME::
freopen - Reopen a stream with a different file and mode.

SYNOPSIS::

[source,c]
---------------------
#include <stdio.h>

FILE *freopen (const char *filename , const char *mode , FILE *stream); 
---------------------

DESCRIPTION::

+freopen+ first tries to close any file already open
associated with the given stream. Then, whether the stream was
closed or not, +freopen+ opens the file which name is pointed by
+filename+ string and associates it with the specified stream.

PARAMETERS::

* filename - name of the file to be opened. This parameter must follow operating system's specifications and can include a path if the system supports it.
* stream - pointer to open file that has to be reopened.
* mode - type of access requested. It can be:


[frame="all",colspecs="cl",cols="^1,10",caption_voffset="0mm"]
|=========================================================
| "r"  | Open a file for reading. The file must exist.
| "w"  | Create an empty file for writing. If a file with the same name already exists its content is erased.
| "a"  | Append to a file. Writing operations append data at the end of the file. The file is created if it doesn't exist.
| "r+" | Open a file for reading and writing. The file must exist.
| "w+" | Create an empty file for reading and writing. If a file with the same name already exists its content is erased before it is opened.
| "a+" | Open a file for reading and appending. All writing operations are done at the end of the file protecting the previous content to be overwritten. You can reposition (+fseek+, +rewind+) the pointer to anywhere in the file for reading, but writing operations will move back to the end of file. The file is created if it doesn't exist.
|=========================================================


The mode parameter serves also to specify whether we want to open the file as text or binary, adding +t+ or +b+ characters to this access mode string.


[frame="all",colspecs="cl",cols="^1,10",caption_voffset="0mm"]
|=========================================================
| t  | Text mode. In text mode the end of file is assumed to be at first `Ctrl-Z` character. Some conversions can occur reading and writing with End Of Line / Feedback characters depending on your
compiler and your Operating System.
| b  | Binary mode. End of file is reached at last byte of the file. No conversions.
|=========================================================

This additional +t+ or +b+ characters can be appended to the read/write mode at the end of the string (like `"rb"`, `"wt"`, `"r+t"`, `"w+b"` ...) or can be inserted between the letter and the `+`
character (like `"rt+"`, `"wb+"`). If +t+ nor +b+ are given the default method (commonly +t+) is used. In most compilers this default method is specified by the global variable `_fmode` defined in +stdio.h+.

RETURN VALUE::

If the file has been successfully reopened the function returns a pointer to the file. Otherwise a NULL pointer is returned.

SEE ALSO::

+fopen+, +fclose+

EXAMPLE::

[source,c]
---------------------
include::src/freopen.c[]
---------------------

This sample code redirects the output that normally would go to standard output to a file, that after
this program is executed contains: `This sentence is redirected to a file.`

OUTPUT::

.....
$ gcc -Wall freopen.c
$ ./a.out test.txt
$ cat test.txt
This sentence is redirected to a file.
.....
