NAME::
rand - Generate a random number.

SYNOPSIS::

[source,c]
---------------------
#include <stdlib.h>

int rand(void);
---------------------

DESCRIPTION::

Returns a pseudo-random number in the range from +0+ to the +RAND_MAX+ constant. This is generated by an algorithm that returns a series of non-related numbers each time is called. The algorithm should be initialized to different starting points using function +srand+ to generate more realistic random numbers. +RAND_MAX+ is a constant defined in +stdlib.h+. Its default value is implementation
specific.

PARAMETERS::

None.

RETURN VALUE::

An integer value between +0+ and +RAND_MAX+.

SEE ALSO::

+srand+

EXAMPLE::

[source,c]
---------------------
include::src/rand.c[]
---------------------

OUTPUT::

.....
$ gcc -Wall rand.c
$ ./a.out +
A number between 0 and RAND_MAX (2147483647): 108411866
A number between 0 and 99: 2
A number between 20 and 29: 25
.....


A good way to generate almost-true random numbers is to initialize the random algorithm using +srand+ with the current time in seconds as parameter, as obtained from time function included in +time.h+. Furthermore, in order to obtain an integer random number in between a range 0 to +RAND_MAX+ use the modulo (%) operation on a result provided by +rand()+: thus +rand()%25+ would be a
random number between +0+ and +24+, both included.
