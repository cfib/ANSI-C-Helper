longjmp
-------

NAME::
longjmp - non-local jump to a saved stack context.

SYNOPSIS::

[source,c]
---------------------
#include <setjmp.h>

void longjmp(jmp_buf env, int val);
---------------------

DESCRIPTION::

+longjmp()+ and +setjmp()+ are useful for dealing with
errors and interrupts encountered in a low-level subroutine of a
program. +longjmp()+ restores the environment saved by the last call
of +setjmp()+ with the corresponding env argument. After +longjmp()+ is
completed, program execution continues as if the corresponding call
of +setjmp()+ had just returned the value val. +longjmp()+ cannot cause
0 to be returned. If +longjmp+ is invoked with a second argument of
0, 1 will be returned instead.

RETURN VALUE::

This function never returns.

SEE ALSO::

+setjmp+

EXAMPLE::

[source,c]
---------------------
include::src/longjmp.c[]
---------------------

OUTPUT::

.....
$ gcc -Wall longjmp.c
$ ./a.out 
Calling function.
Reached this point from a longjmp with value=5.
