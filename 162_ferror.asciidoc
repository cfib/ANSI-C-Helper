[[ferror]]
ferror
------

NAME::
ferror - Check for errors.

SYNOPSIS::

[source,c]
---------------------
#include <stdio.h>

int ferror(FILE *stream);
---------------------

DESCRIPTION::

Tests if a error has occurred in the last reading or
writing operation with the given stream, returning a non-zero value
in case of error. If indeed there has been an error the error
indicator will not be modified by a call to this function. You
should call +clearerr+ or rewind to reset it.

RETURN VALUE::

If there were no errors a 0 value is returned.
Otherwise a non-zero value is returned and the error indicator of
the stream will remain set.

SEE ALSO::

+feof+, +clearerr+, +perror+

EXAMPLE::

[source,c]
---------------------
include::src/ferror.c[]
---------------------
The above program opens an existing file whose file name is provided as command-line argument in read-only mode. The program, however, tries to write a character to it, generating an error that is caught by +ferror+.


OUTPUT::

.....
$ gcc -Wall ferror.c
$ ./a.out 
Error opening file: Bad address
$ ./a.out ferror.c
Error Writing to ferror.c.
