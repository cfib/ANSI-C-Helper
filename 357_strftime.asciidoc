strftime
--------

NAME::
strftime - Format date and time.

SYNOPSIS::

[source,c]
---------------------
#include <time.h>

size_t strftime(char *s, size_t max, const char *format, const struct tm *tm);
---------------------

DESCRIPTION::

The +strftime()+ function formats the broken-down time +tm+ according to the format specification format and places the result in the character array s of size max. Ordinary characters placed in the format string are copied to s without conversion. Conversion specifiers are introduced by a `'%'` character, and are replaced in s as follows:


[frame="all",colspecs="cl",cols="^1,10",caption_voffset="0mm"]
|==================================================
|%a   | The abbreviated weekday name according to the current locale.
|%A   | The full weekday name according to the current locale.
|%b   | The abbreviated month name according to the current locale.
|%B   | The full month name according to the current locale.
|%c   | The preferred date and time representation for the current locale.
|%d   | The day of the month as a decimal number (range 0 to 31).
|%H   | The hour as a decimal number using a 24-hour clock (range 00 to 23).
|%I   | The hour as a decimal number using a 12-hour clock (range 01 to 12).
|%j   | The day of the year as a decimal number (range 001 to 366).
|%m   | The month as a decimal number (range 10 to 12).
|%M   | The minute as a decimal number.
|%p   | Either `am' or `pm' according to the given time value, or the corresponding strings for the current locale.
|%S   | The second as a decimal number.
|%U   | The week number of the current year as a decimal number, starting with the first Sunday as the first day of the first week.
|%W   | The week number of the current year as a decimal number, starting with the first Monday as the first day of the first week.
|%w   | The day of the week as a decimal, Sunday being 0.
|%x   | The preferred date representation for the current locale without the time.
|%X   | The preferred time representation for the current locale without the date.
|%y   | The year as a decimal number without a century (range 00 to 99).

PARAMETERS::
* s - Points to the array containing the output date and time string.
* max - Specifies the maximum number of bytes or wide characters to be written to the array pointed to by the +s+ or +wcs+ parameter.
* format - Points to a sequence of characters that specify the format of the date and time to be written to the output string or wide-character string.
* tm - Points to a type +tm+ structure that contains broken-down time information.

RETURN VALUE::

The +strftime()+ function returns the number of characters placed in the array s, not including the terminating NULL character. If the value equals max, it means that the array was too small.

SEE ALSO::

["NOTE",voffset="0mm"]
The `%S` seconds field can contain a value up to 61 seconds rather than up to 59 seconds to allow leap seconds that are sometimes added to years to keep clocks in correspondence with the
solar year.
