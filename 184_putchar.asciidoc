NAME::
putchar - Write character to STDOUT.

SYNOPSIS::

[source,c]
-----
#include <stdio.h>

int putchar(int c);
-----

DESCRIPTION::

Writes character to the current position in the standard output (stdout) and increases the file pointer to point to next character. This routine corresponds to: +putc(character,stdout)+.

PARAMETERS::

* character - Character to be written. Although it is declared as +int+, the function converts it to
+unsigned char+ before it writes it.

RETURN VALUE::

The value returned is the written character. If an error occurs, EOF is returned. Note that when you work with binary files EOF is a valid character and you must use +ferror()+ function
to check if it has been an error.
