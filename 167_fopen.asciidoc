fopen
-----

NAME::
fopen - Open a file.

SYNOPSIS::

[source,c]
---------------------
#include <stdio.h>

FILE *fopen (const char *filename, const char *mode); 
---------------------

DESCRIPTION::

Opens the file which name is stored in the
+filename+ string and returns a pointer to the file (stream). Operations
allowed to the file returned are defined by the mode parameter:

[colspecs="cl",cols="^1,9",caption_voffset="0mm"]
|================================
| "r"  | Open a file for reading. The file must exist.
| "w"  | Create an empty file for writing. If a file with the same name already exists its content is erased.
| "a"  | Append to a file. Writing operations append data at the end of the file. The file is created if it doesn't exist.
| "r+" | Open a file for reading and writing. The file must exist.
| "w+" | Create an empty file for reading and writing. If a file with the same name already exists its content is erased before it is opened.
| "a+" | Open a file for reading and appending. All writing operations are done at the end of the file protecting the previous content to be overwritten. You can reposition (+fseek+, +rewind+) the pointer to anywhere in the file for reading, but writing operations will move back to the end of file. The file is created if it doesn't exist.
|================================


The mode parameter serves also to specify whether we want to open the file as text or binary, adding
+t+ or +b+ characters to this access mode string.

[colspecs="cl",cols="^1,9",caption_voffset="0mm"]
|=================================
| t | Text mode. In text mode the end of file is assumed to be at first Ctrl-Z character. Some conversions can occur reading and writing with End Of Line / Feedback characters depending on your compiler and your Operating System.
| b | Binary mode. End of file is reached at last byte of the file. No conversions.
|=================================



This additional +t+ or +b+ characters can be appended to the read/write
mode at the end of the string (like "rb", "wt", "r+t", "w+b" ...)
or can be inserted between the letter and the "+" character (like "rt+", "wb+").

If +t+ nor +b+ are given, the default method is used (commonly +t+). Most compilers use the default method specified by the global variable `_fmode` defined in +stdio.h+.

RETURN VALUE::

If the file has been successfully opened the function will return a pointer to the file. Otherwise a NULL pointer is returned.
