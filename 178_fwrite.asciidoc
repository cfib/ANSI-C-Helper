[[fwrite]]
fwrite
------

NAME::
fwrite - Write a block of data to a stream.

SYNOPSIS::

[source,c]
---------------------
#include <stdio.h>

size_t fwrite( const void *buffer, size_t size, size_t count, FILE *stream ); 
---------------------

DESCRIPTION::

Writes count number of items, each one with a size of
size bytes, from the memory block pointed by buffer to the current
position in the stream. Stream's position indicator is increased by
the number of bytes written. On files opened in text mode some
translations may occur with carriage-return and line-feed
characters. The total number of bytes to be written is (size x
count). Normally the parameter size should contain the size of each
item (+char+, +int+, +long+, structures ...) to be written and count the
number of these items. But this is not absolute, you can specify
any combination of numbers which result of (+size x count+) match the
size in bytes of the block to be written.

PARAMETERS::

* buffer - Pointer to data to be written.
* size - Size in bytes of each item that has to be written.
* count - Number of items, each one with a size of size bytes.
* stream - Pointer to an open file with writing access.

RETURN VALUE::

Number of full items (not bytes) successfully written. This may be less than the specified in count parameter if an error occurred.

SEE ALSO::

+fread+, +fscanf+, +getc+, +fgetc+

EXAMPLE::

[source,c]

include::src/fwrite.c[]

OUTPUT::

.....
$ gcc -Wall fwrite.c
$ ./a.out test.txt
$ cat test.txt
This buffer contains some characters.
