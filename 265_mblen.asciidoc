mblen
-----

NAME::
mblen - Returns the length of a multibyte character.


SYNOPSIS::

[source,c]
---------------------
#include <stdlib.h>

int mblen(const char *c, size_t num); 
---------------------


DESCRIPTION::

The function calculates the length of the multibyte character +c+. At most, the multibyte character may consist of +num+ bytes.

PARAMETERS::
* c - Pointer to the first byte of a multibyte character. Alternatively, the function may be called with a null pointer, in which case the function resets its internal shift state to the initial value and returns whether multibyte characters have state-dependent encodings or not.
* num - Maximum number of bytes to be checked for character length. No more than MB_CUR_MAX characters are examined in any case.

RETURN VALUE::
If the argument passed as +c+ is not a null pointer, the size in bytes of the character pointed by +c+ is returned when it forms a valid multibyte character and is not the terminating null character. If it is the terminating null character, the function returns zero, and in the case they do not form a valid multibyte character, -1 is returned. +
If the argument passed as +c+ is a null pointer, the function returns a nonzero value if multibyte character encodings are state-dependent, and zero otherwise.
