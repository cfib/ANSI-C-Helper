fread
-----

NAME::
fread - Read a block of data from a stream.

SYNOPSIS::

[source,c]
---------------------
#include <stdio.h>

int fread (void *buffer, size_t size, size_t count, FILE *stream); 
---------------------

DESCRIPTION::

Read count number of items each one with a size of
size bytes from the stream and stores it in the specified buffer.
Stream's position indicator is increased by the number of bytes
read. Total amount of bytes read is (size * count).

PARAMETERS::

* buffer - Pointer to the destination structure with a minimum size of (`size*count`) bytes.
* size - Size in bytes of each item to be read.
* count - Number of items, each one with a size of size bytes.
* stream - pointer to an open file.

RETURN VALUE::

The total number of items read is returned. If this
number differs from the requested amount (count parameter) an error
has occurred or End Of File has been reached. To determine what
happened call +feof+ or +ferror+.

SEE ALSO::

+fgetc+, +fread+, +fwrite+, +fopen+

EXAMPLE::
