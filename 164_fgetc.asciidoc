NAME::
fgetc - Get the next character from a stream.

SYNOPSIS::

[source,c]
---------------------
#include <stdio.h>

int fgetc(FILE *stream);
---------------------

DESCRIPTION::

Returns the next character of the stream and increases
the file pointer to point to the following one.

RETURN VALUE::

The character read is returned as an +int+ value. If the
End Of File has been reached or there has been an error reading,
the function returns +EOF+. You can use +ferror()+ or +feof()+ to
determine whether an error happened or the End-Of-File was
reached.

SEE ALSO::

EXAMPLE::

[source,c]
---------------------
include::src/fgetc.c[]
---------------------

The above program reads a file whose file name is provided as command-line argument
character by character and uses the variable +n+ to count how many
'a' characters are found.

OUTPUT::

.....
$ gcc -Wall fgetc.c
$ ./a.out fgetc.c
File contains 11 'a' characters.
.....

EXAMPLE::

[source,c]
---------------------
include::src/fgetc2.c[]
---------------------

This example simply reads character after character from a file and prints it to the screen.

OUTPUT::

.....
$ gcc -Wall fgetc2.c
$ ./a.out fgetc2.c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[1])
{
  int c;
  FILE *ptr;

  ptr = fopen(argv[1],"r");
  while ((c = fgetc(ptr)) != EOF)  {
    printf("%c",c);
  }
  fclose(ptr);
  return 0;
}
