NAME::
ctime - Convert time_t value to string.

SYNOPSIS::

[source,c]
---------------------
#include <time.h>

char *ctime ( const time_t * timer ); 
---------------------

DESCRIPTION::

Converts timer to a string containing time and date
adjusted to local time zone in readable format. timer is an integer
value of type time_t defined as long int by default in most
compilers, and usually returned by a call to time function. The
returned string has the following format: +Www Mmm dd
hh:mm:ss yyyy+ where +Www+ is the weekday, +Mmm+ the month in
letters, +dd+ the day of the month, +hh:mm:ss+ the time, and +yyyy+ the
year. The string is followed by a new-line character (+\n+) and a
terminating null-character, conforming a total of 26
characters.

PARAMETERS::

* tmptr - Pointer to a time_t value, usually returned by time function.

RETURN VALUE::

A pointer to the string containing the date and time
information in readable format. The string pointed is statically
allocated and shared by +ctime+ and +asctime+ functions. Each time one
of these functions is called the content of the string is
overwritten. +ctime+ also uses internally the buffer used by +gmtime+
and +localtime+ as return value, so a call to this function will
overwrite this.

SEE ALSO::

+asctime+, +gmtime+, +localtime+, +time+
