NAME::
mbtowc - Convert a multibyte character to a wide character.

SYNOPSIS::

[source,c]
---------------------
#include <stdlib.h>

int mbtowc(wchar_t *wchar, const char *mbchar, size_t count);
---------------------

DESCRIPTION::
The +mbtowc+ function converts +count+ or fewer bytes
pointed to by +mbchar+, if +mbchar+ is not NULL, to a corresponding
wide character. +mbtowc+ stores the resulting wide character at
+wchar+, if +wchar+ is not NULL. +mbtowc+ does not examine more than
+MB_CUR_MAX+ bytes.

PARAMETERS::

* wchar - Address of a wide character (type +wchar_t+).
* mbchar - Address of a sequence of bytes (a multibyte character).
* count - Number of bytes to check.

RETURN VALUE::

If +mbchar+ is not NULL and if the object that +mbchar+
points to forms a valid multibyte character, +mbtowc+ returns the
length in bytes of the multibyte character. If +mbchar+ is NULL or
the object that it points to is a wide-character null character
(`L'\0'`), the function returns 0. If the object that +mbchar+ points
to does not form a valid multibyte character within the first count
characters, it returns -1.

OUTPUT::

.....
$ gcc mbtowc.c
$ ./a.out 
Convert a wide character to multibyte character:
 Characters converted: 1
 Multibyte character: 61

Convert multibyte character back to a wide character:
 Bytes converted: 1
 Wide character: 61

Attempt to convert when target is NULL
 returns the length of the multibyte character:
 Length of multibyte character: 1
