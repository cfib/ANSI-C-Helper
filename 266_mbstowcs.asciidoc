NAME::
mbstowcs - Convert a multibyte string to a wide character string.

SYNOPSIS::

[source,c]
---------------------
#include <stdlib.h>

size_t mbstowcs(wchar_t *wcstr, const char *mbstr, size_t count);
---------------------

DESCRIPTION::

The +mbstowcs+ function converts up to a maximum number
of count multibyte characters pointed to by +mbstr+ to a string of
corresponding wide characters that are determined by the current
locale. It stores the resulting wide-character string at the
address represented by +wcstr+. The result is similar to a series of
calls to +mbtowc+. If +mbstowcs+ encounters the single-byte null
character ('\0') either before or when count occurs, it converts
the null character to a wide-character null character (L'\0') and
stops. Thus the wide-character string at +wcstr+ is null-terminated
only if a null character is encountered during conversion. If the
sequences pointed to by +wcstr+ and +mbstr+ overlap, the behavior is
undefined. If the +wcstr+ argument is NULL, +mbstowcs+ returns the
required size of the destination string.

PARAMETERS::

* wcstr - The address of a sequence of wide characters.
* mbstr - The address of a sequence of null terminated multibyte characters.
* count - The maximum number of multibyte characters to convert.

RETURN VALUE::

The number of characters translated, not including the ending null-character.
If an invalid multibyte character is encountered, a -1 value is returned.
