NAME::
rename - Rename a file or directory.

SYNOPSIS::

[source,c]
---------------------
#include <stdio.h>

int rename(const char *oldname , const char *newname); 
---------------------

DESCRIPTION::

Renames the file or directory specified by +oldname+ to +newname+. If +oldname+ and +newname+ specify different paths the file is moved.

PARAMETERS::

* oldname - Path and name of the file to be renamed or moved. This file must exist and we must have write access to it.
* newname - New path and name for the file. This filename must not be the same of an existing one.

RETURN VALUE::

If the file is successfully renamed/moved a 0 value is returned. On error a non-zero value is returned and the +errno+ variable is set to the corresponding error code that can be printed using +perror+.

SEE ALSO::

EXAMPLE::

[source,c]
---------------------
include::src/rename.c[]
---------------------

OUTPUT::

.....
$ ./a.out old.txt new.txt
$ cat new.txt 
Hello World!
$ cat old.txt
cat: old.txt: No such file or directory
.....

If the file +old.txt+ exists before execution and we meet the permission requirements to call this function the file will be renamed to +new.txt+, otherwise a message similar to `STDERR: Error renaming file: Permission denied` will be output.
