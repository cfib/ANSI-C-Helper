rewind
------

NAME::
rewind - Repositions the file pointer to the beginning of a stream.

SYNOPSIS::

[source,c]
---------------------
#include <stdio.h>

void rewind ( FILE *stream ); 
---------------------

DESCRIPTION::

Sets the file pointer associated with the stream to the beginning of the file. A call to +rewind+ is equivalent to: +fseek(stream , 0L , SEEK_SET);+ except that unlike +fseek+, using +rewind+ the error indicator is cleared. The next operation with the stream after a call to +fseek+ can be either for input or output. This function is also useful for clearing the keyboard buffer (normally associated with stdin).

PARAMETERS::

* stream - Pointer to an open file.

RETURN VALUE::

None.

SEE ALSO::

+fseek+

EXAMPLE::

[source,c]
---------------------
include::src/rewind.c[]
---------------------


A file is created for reading and writing and filled with the alphabet. The file is rewinded, read
and its content is stored in a buffer. Finally, the read content is written to the standard output (screen).

OUTPUT::

.....
$ gcc -Wall rewind.c
$ ./a.out file.txt 
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
$ cat file.txt 
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
.....
