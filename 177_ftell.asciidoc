[[ftell]]
ftell
-----

NAME::
ftell - Return the current position in a stream.

SYNOPSIS::

[source,c]
---------------------
#include <stdio.h>

long ftell ( FILE *stream ); 
---------------------

DESCRIPTION::

Returns the current position pointed by the position
indicator of the stream. When a file has been opened in binary mode
the value obtained corresponds to the number of bytes from the
beginning of the file. In files opened in text-mode this is not
granted because of carriage-return translations under that mode.
The value returned is valid for further calls to +fseek+.

PARAMETERS::

* stream - Pointer to an open file.

RETURN VALUE::

On success, the current file pointer position is
returned. If an error occurs -1 is returned and the global
variable errno is set to a positive value. If the stream is unable
to perform seeking operations the return value is
undefined.

SEE ALSO::

+fopen+, +fseek+, +fgetpos+

EXAMPLE::

[source,c]
---------------------
include::src/ftell.c[]
---------------------


This program opens a file for reading and calculates its size by simply positioning the file-pointer to the end.

OUTPUT::

.....
$ gcc -Wall ftell.c
$ ./a.out test.txt
Size of test.txt: 18 bytes.
.....
