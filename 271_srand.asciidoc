srand
-----

NAME::
srand - Initialize random number generator.

SYNOPSIS::

[source,c]
---------------------
#include <stdlib.h>

int srand ( unsigned int seed );
---------------------

DESCRIPTION::

Uses seed parameter to set a new starting point for generating random numbers with rand. If seed is set to 1 the generator is reinitialized to its initial value as before any call to rand or srand. In order to generate true random numbers it is suggested to use as seed a value that changes often, like the one returned by time function included in +time.h+ (the number of seconds elapsed since newyear 1970).

PARAMETERS::

* seed - An integer value to be used as starting point with the pseudo-random number generator algorithm.

RETURN VALUE::

None.

SEE ALSO::

+rand+

A number between 0 and 100: 22
A number between 20 and 30: 25
$ ./a.out 
A number between 0 and 100: 33
A number between 20 and 30: 28
