SYNOPSIS::

[source,c]
---------------------
#include <stdlib.h>

div_t div (int numerator, int denominator); 
---------------------

DESCRIPTION::

+numerator+ is divided by +denominator+. Quotient and remainder are
returned in a +div_t+ structure.

PARAMETERS::

* numerator - Numerator.
* denominator - Denominator.

RETURN VALUE::
A +div_t+ structure is returned:

.....
typedef struct { int quot; int rem;} div_t;
.....

The +div_t+ structure is defined in +stdlib.h+ and has two
members of type int +quot+ representing the quotient, and +rem+
representing the remainder.

OUTPUT::

.....
$ gcc -Wall div.c
$ ./a.out 
Enter two integers separated by a space > 38 5
38 / 5 = 7 ( 3
.....
