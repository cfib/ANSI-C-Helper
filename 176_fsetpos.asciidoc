fsetpos
-------

NAME::
fsetpos - Reposition file pointer to a saved location.

SYNOPSIS::

[source,c]
---------------------
#include <stdio.h>

int fsetpos ( FILE *stream , const fpos_t *position ); 
---------------------

DESCRIPTION::

Sets the file pointer associated with stream to a new position. The position parameter is a value previously obtained by a call to +fgetpos+. After a call to this function, the End-Of-File indicator of the stream is cleared and any effect of a previous call to +ungetc+ is undone. The next operation with the stream after a call to +fsetpos+ can be either for input or output.

PARAMETERS::

* stream - Pointer to an open file.
* position - Position value obtained from a previous call to +fgetpos+ that indicates the position of the file pointer at that moment.

RETURN VALUE::

If successful the function returns 0. Otherwise it returns nonzero and sets the global variable errno to a non-zero value.

SEE ALSO::

+fopen+, +fgetpos+, +fseek+, +ftell+, +frewind+

EXAMPLE::

[source,c]
---------------------
include::src/fsetpos.c[]
---------------------

The above example first obtains the actual position of the file pointer. Next, it writes `That is a sample.` to the file. Than the file pointer is re-positioned using +fsetpos+ and parts of the text get overwritten.


OUTPUT::

.....
$ gcc -Wall fsetpos.c
$ ./a.out test.txt
$ cat test.txt
This is a sample.
